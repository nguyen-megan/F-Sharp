Solve the knapsack problem using dynamic programming
Accepts an input file contains the set of value and weight of items, and a capacity for the knapsack
Display the knapsack capacity, value generated, and the set of items (weight, value) in the solution 

Instruction:
    1.call make to compile the program
    2.call ./hw5 file_name/path_name capacity to execute the program
      
    example (cs1):
    [nguyenmegan@cs1 hw5]$ make
    [nguyenmegan@cs1 hw5]$ ./hw5 input.txt 18

Note: 
*Command line take exactly 3 arguments:
    - program name: ./hw5
    - file/path_name: if file in directory then file name
                      else full path name
    - capacity: must be an integer   

*Assume that the total number of entries in the first and second line
 of any input file would be the same
